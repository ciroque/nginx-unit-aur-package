 nginx-unit-aur-package
Configuration for creating a NGINX Unit package for Arch Linux

This is based on [the aur nginx-unitd](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/nginx-unitd) package, just updated to build 1.29.0 instead of 1.27.0.

Some day I will make time to turn this into a real boy. But it is not this day.
